## File documentation


Antibiotic resistance is a serious problem in modern medicine. Diseases caused by resistant bacteria are difficult to treat, and sometimes even untreatable. To fight such bacteria, biologists and physicians are constantly looking for new approaches, and one of the options is metal nanoparticle therapy. Metal nanoparticles can both affect bacteria independently (by damaging bacterial membranes and generating radical particles) and enhance the effect of antibiotics.

The task is to build a predictive regression model to predict the ZOI - zone of inhibition of bacterial growth - for drug-nanoparticle complexes.
